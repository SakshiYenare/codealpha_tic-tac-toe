# codealpha_tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with either "X" or "O." The game continues until one player achieves three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or until all the spaces are filled, resulting in a draw.

The interface of the game would likely feature a visual 3x3 grid, where each cell can be clicked to place a mark. The game might include logic to check for a winner or detect a draw, along with options for restarting the game or resetting the board. You might have also used JavaScript for handling game state, such as player turns and win conditions, and potentially CSS to style the board and improve the user experience.

Overall, this is a fun, interactive game that involves strategy, quick thinking, and a simple yet effective design!
